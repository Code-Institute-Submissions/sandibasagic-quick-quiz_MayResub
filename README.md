## Design Choices

### Fonts
The selected font is imported and found at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google fonts"). From the beginning of the font search, I wanted font that is not to hard to read. When choosing fonts, I came across font named "Signika". It looked right for the website and is easy to read. In case of fallback, I included CSS generic font family "sans-serif".

### Colours 
I have used [RGBA Color Picker](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/ "RGBA Colorpicker") for picking colors. General experience from visiting website should be pleasing and nice. This is why I included bright and colorful colors, but setting their opacity to low values so the colors dont fall out and don't distract the user. In case of late change, I will work with variables so if needed, colors can be changed quickly. 

 ### Structure
 I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the 320px as the smallest screen size for styling to look good. Mobile first aproach is also used, as its expected that most users will visit the site through mobile device. I used this breakpoints, as they seem to be standard. 

 | Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes 

I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframe for the website. From the start, I am planning to build mobile first and then stretch it to fit larger screen sizes. When drawing my Wireframes, I haven't looked into colours, but did basic element positioning to get a brief presentation on how the website should look.

The wireframes are below:
