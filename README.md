## Design Choices

### Fonts
The selected font is imported and found at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google fonts"). From the beginning of the font search, I wanted font that is not to hard to read. When choosing fonts, I came across font named "Signika". It looked right for the website and is easy to read. In case of fallback, I included CSS generic font family "sans-serif".
